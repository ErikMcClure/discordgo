DiscordGo Ping Pong Example.

This is an example bot that will respond to "ping" with "Pong!" and 
"pong" with "Ping!" on any channel it has access to.

This example requires the use of an **Authentication Token** for login instead
of an email and password.  If you don't know your token you can use the 
**mytoken** example to get it.
